Daniel Leite's programming portfolio

As I was getting more and more interested in programming, I got hired to work as a junior consultant for Accenture. But before I could start working, I had to undergo an intensive coding academy to learn how to work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Java. This repository is my way to show my work and to document my evolution as a programmer.
